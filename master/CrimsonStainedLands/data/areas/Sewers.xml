down. You can just make out a huge dark pool out there in the darkness,

washes over this ledge and makes it quite slippery. From here it drops, 
like a waterfall, into the pool far down.</Description>

      <Name>The fissure under the ledge</Name>
      <Description>This is a small fissure in the solid rock. Under you lies the deep dark pool.
The water trickles quietly down from the ledge above you. The water smells 
like the water in a sewer.</Description>

      <Description>You stand in a small room with a great big opening in the ceiling. From this
opening there's mud dripping down in large lumps. &gt;YUCK&lt;. You can smell the 
foul stench of the slimy sediment as you try not to get covered by the 
falling sludge. To the east there is an entryway leading out from here and 
it seems absolutely impossible to force the muddy descent.</Description>

resemble pipes anymore. They look more like a real stone tunnel, or a
passageway hewn directly into the rock. The ways from here lead north, east

      <Description>This is an utterly silent place. As you look around you see that there
hasn't been a living thing in a long time. The dust lies here in a thick
layer on the floor and on the furniture. On the wall hangs a bleak and 
worn tapestry. A winding stone staircase leads up into darkness. On the 
wall to the west you can see a huge torch stuck into the solid rock.
A large portcullis blocks your way to the north.</Description>
