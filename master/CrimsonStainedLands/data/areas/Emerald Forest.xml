      <Name>A Fog-Shrouded Trail</Name>
      <Description>You are on a fog-shrouded trail which runs up the side of this dark
mountain. The ground is wet and muddy with melted snow, and the path which
should lead to the Miden'nir disappears amongst the mist and the trees.
There is nothing for you to do but follow the trail that twists up towards
the broken, snow-covered heights of the mountain range. An old stone tablet
with inscriptions stands beside a bush in the corner.</Description>

      <Name>The Haunted Pine Forest</Name>
      <Description>The snow begins to fall thickly as you enter a pine forest in the
mountains. The burnt remains of two log cabins lie in a clearing about a
dozen yards off the path. There is a disconcerting silence in these woods,
an oppressive lifelessness that makes you want to leave them immediately.
The trail stretches through these haunted woods up the side of the mountain
and down through the fog to the foothills of the range.</Description>

      <Name>Near the Summit</Name>
      <Description>It has become almost unbearably cold as you trek near the very summit of
the mountain. The bare and broken trees provide no cover for you as a cold
and gusty wind whips the falling snow harshly into your face. A pine forest
covers the slopes of the mountain, while to your south you spot a narrow
mountain pass.</Description>

      <Description>You are in a secluded dell at the foot of a great mountain range. Old
valley ash are crowned with the slightest hint of frost, and bushes of
flowering foxglove line the bank of a stream which runs west into a small
vale. To the south there is a great forest of majestic oaks, while to your
east a trail that seems little-used heads into the mountains.</Description>

      <Name>A Signpost in the Enchanted Forests</Name>
      <Description>Through the majestic oaks of these ancient woods, the deep earthiness of
the forest permeates your senses, while a gentle hum of magic in the air
pulses low and vibrant. A shy nymph peeks inquisitively at you from behind a
tree before disappearing with a titter. An old but sturdy signpost stands
beside a crossing in the paths, which lead in every direction.</Description>

      <Description>The path has taken you to a junction over which hangs the twisted
branches of two Blackthorn trees and an Elderwood tree. You remember
folktales which tell that spiteful faeries lurk under the meetings of such
trees to waylay and confound woodland travellers. Feeling a little
uncomfortable, you look south, where the forest seems to darken menacingly.
The east trail beckons you to the safety of the Emerald Forest.</Description>

      <Description>You are on an old road which runs alongside a clear stream. It leads to
the Vale of Clover, a small valley at the foot of the mountains. Looking
down the road, you see a small village nestled beside a bend in the stream.
Tall heather blows in the wind and you see some cows grazing idly nearby.
The road east runs down into a wooded dell.</Description>

green with shadynooks and pivate arbors. The hillock continues north, while

      <Name>A Secluded Corner of the Meadow</Name>
      <Description>You are in a quiet corner of the meadow, well-shaded by two large cypress
trees. Though empty now, it seems a likely spot for young couples to
exchange professions of love, undisturbed by friends or irate parents.
Having no time for such adolescent frivolities, you quickly scan the
countryside and note that from this vantage point, you can look over the
entire village of Clover. You espy a dirt track which leads west from the
village and then turns north to a ruined abbey.</Description>

freeman and entrepreneur - seems to be having a little trouble keeping his
livestock in order. His chickens are harrying his ducks in the duck pond,
while a big brown shaggy dog is chasing his pigs around the entire farm.
From inside a blue and yellow farmhouse you hear Princess Yaruga, the

      <Name>The Entrance of the Witch Wood</Name>
      <Description>Your uneasiness mounts as you walk along this haunted stretch of road.
The mist clears, and you find yourself in a nightmarish forest. The empty
husk of a dead nymph lies at your feet, and on either side of you, the trees
look twisted and tortured into unnatural shapes. The depths of the forest
sends up a hopeless cry to usher you into the woods that ring the edge of
Hell.</Description>

      <Description>The path continues darkly under rows of Elder trees. A crooked road leads
west through a tangled hedge of briars. A mist prevents you from looking
beyond the hedge, but you sense a powerful and oppressive evil reaching out
towards you with cold and clawed fingers. To the south, the forest seems to
lighten considerably, and you are about to leave in that direction when a
tattered parchment, flapping weakly in the wind, falls at your feet.</Description>

          <Description>(Parchment: It is yellowed and seems savagely ripped from a tome. "... I
mouthed a prayer for my fallen brother Alandro as I raised his morning-star
to smite the foul witch who had struck him down. But I had reckoned without
her Sisters, and the twain now flew shrieking towards me. The first,
diabolically transformed, pinioned me to the ground, while her corrupt
breath drove the sight from my eyes and caused boils to burst from my skin.
The other, whom I had seen to be beautiful but terrible even as I was made
blind, wrested my weapon from me and tore at my face. I know not how I fled
from their cursed abode, but the relief I felt then at my escape was vainly
felt, for even now, I nightly suffer the torments of their evil
blandishments. In my sleep I see myself being chased at the edge of a black
abyss by the Devil's huntsmen and their hellhounds slavering for my soul. I
wake up drained, I feel both my faith and my sanity slipping from me. We had
been foolishly proud, thinking we could destroy those servants of evil
alone. Now we are undone, and the relic of our Holy Saint is lost forever."

staying here forever. Woodlarks are singing high in the boughs of trees
while shafts of sunlight turn the forest floor into a carpet of gold and
green. The woodland trails running through this area of the forest seem
well-kept, yet untravelled.</Description>

      <Description>A circle of blue-capped mushrooms form an old faerie ring by the side of
the path you are on. On certain nights of the year, the faerie folk wander
out into such rings for wild dances by the moonlight. It is said that
mortals who are drawn into the dancing circle on such nights can be held
captive by faerie food or a faerie's kiss and made to dance on and on for a
period of seven years. You hear a titter of laughter from the branches of a
tree, but when you look up you see nothing.</Description>

      <Name>Before the Great Tree</Name>
      <Description>You stand at the perimeter of the largest, most incredible tree that you
have ever laid eyes on. It has gold-flecked leaves that are the size of
small horses, with thick roots supporting a massive trunk that is easily
twice the size of the grand fortress of the Templar Knights of Renhorden. It
seems to stretch endlessly into the sky, and you wonder why you did not see
it towering above all the other trees in the forest. You long to inch
closer, but cannot seem to move beyond an invisible barrier that keeps you
about a hundred yards away. You see movement and lights in and about the
tree, but there seems to be no way you can get closer to it.</Description>

      <Description>You follow the stream to a limpid pool where the waters lap gently
against the rocks. Large ferns provide shade from above and the petals of
brightly-colored flowers float in the pool. Sitting on the moss- covered
rocks by the pool is a slim young girl dressed in green. She has long black
hair and elfin features, a yew bow slung across her back. She seems
oblivious to your presence and hums softly as she passes her hand through
the waters.</Description>

sudden sound of musical laughter, you look over the tops of some lilac
bushes and spy a group of nymphs frolicking in the stream. It seems like a
vision captured from some nature god's idyllic dream. You hear the distant
roar of a waterfall to your south.</Description>

      <Name>The Waterfall Glade</Name>
      <Description>A majestic waterfall pours from high above the mountains to the south.
Great torrents of water crash down on the rocks in a wide pool, and even
where you stand in a shaded glade, the wind blows sprays of water into your
face. A profusion of flowering shrubs grow at the edge of the pool. In a
large shaded retreat made by the overhanging branches of silver oak trees
stands a likeness of Altariel, the Lady of the Woods. At the base of the
waterfall, a rock pool with crystal clear water has formed.</Description>

      <Description>The path here runs around a low grassy mound. Looking closer, you see the
smallest of windows built into the mound. It appears this is a faerie hill,
from which the faerie Rades ride out in celebration through the wood paths
of the Emerald Forest. The angry face of a faerie suddenly stares out at you
from the window and interrupts your scrutiny with a string of curses.</Description>

      <Description>In this small lonely clearing is an ancient stump. Many years ago, a
forester callously hewed down a tree here. In retribution, Altariel, whose
sanctuary the Emerald Forest is, transformed him into a poplar tree. The
poplar tree stands here beside the stump, its branches cut by the rangers of
the forest whenever they are in need of wood.</Description>

      <Description>You have come upon a low hill in the marsh. As you ascend it, you notice
that the fog that covers the rest of the fens rolls away. The weeds are dry
at the edge of the mound and the grass that grows here is is lush and green.
A lone oak tree stands on the mound, like a beacon of goodness that repels
the evil of the witches.</Description>

the gurgling sound of moving water coming from the east, while to the south
the forest continues on with oak, pine and rosewood. Peering intently toward
the source of the sound, you notice a faint outline of a bridge resting in
the shade of the long leafy branches of the tall, flanking trees.</Description>

      <Description>You stand on the western end of a wooden bridge in the Emerald Forest.
It's origin is a mystery, but the fine detail and craftsmanship it bears
would rival even the most cunning of woodsmiths. The branches of the tall
trees that grow on the banks of the stream cover the bridge in a soft cool
embrace while a breeze flows in from the north. Huge salmon and rainbow
trout weave their way amongst the rocks in the stream below. To the west the
forest stretches on, while the sounds of laughter and play drift in softly
from the south.</Description>

      <Name>The Shady bridge</Name>
      <Description>You stand on the eastern end of a finely crafted wooden bridge. It's
edges have small engraved runes carved into them, and the wood is probably a
form of pine or oak from the Emerald Forest itself. Lacking the dull
weathered tone and creaking of most wooden bridges, it spans across a fairly
wide river flowing in a north-south direction. The height of the surrounding
trees provide a pleasant shade from the noon-day sun.</Description>

      <Description>You are following a small woodland trail in the Emerald Forest. The hear
the sound of moving water to the west, and squinting a bit intently you see
a blurred outline of a small wooden bridge in the distance. Who built that
bridge? And why? Only a few seasoned rangers have ever come this deep into
the enchanted wood, and none ever mentioned the existence of construction of
a bridge. As far as you know, the forest has resisted gently but firmly all
attempts at colonisation or lumbering, which makes it quite a curiousity.</Description>

      <Description>You are walking deep in the Emerald Forest. The tall oak trees all around
you offer welcome shade and provide homes for innumerable woodland
creatures. You spot a brown squirrel darting away from the bole of a tree in
an industrious search for more nuts and berries. The paths lead north, south

      <Description>Pushing aside a tangle of falling vines, you find yourself on a trail
deep in an unexplored area of the Emerald Forest. Passage to the north and
south are blocked by clustered thickets of sagebrush and rosemary. The
cheerful croaking of a tree-frog catches your eat, accompanied by the
soprano trill of a swallow and an acapella team of bush insects. The trail
allows travel to the east and west.</Description>

and their curtains of vines obscure the view in any direction. The fresh
scent of wild thicket flowers hang in the air, the source of which cannot be

believe you've happened across someone's quiet time area.</Description>

      <Description>This is a small platform with four walls and a leaf roof rather than a
proper tree house. Nevertheless, it is very cosy and could accomodate two
quite comfortably. A pot of jasmine tea is simmering over a fire and a few
plush cushions are scattered on a rug in one corner. On a shelf on the west
wall are the complete works of Shakespeare, while another book lies
half-read on the floor.</Description>

      <Name>A Small Clearing</Name>
      <Description>You stand in a small clearing deep in the Emerald Forest. The ground
shows no evidence of trees being cut down or any other indication that the
clearing is carved from axe or hand, yet the borders seem too neat to be the
result of Mother Nature's whim. In some areas the shrubs and bushes appear
to have gone out of their way (if that is possible) to align themselves, and
the soft wood grass while not having the blunt heads of a kept garden seem
to be growing neatly in line all by themselves. Strong magic is at work
here.</Description>

directions. The pathways to the north, south and east lead deeper into the
woods, while a winding trail west seems to end in a small clearing. From
where you stand you can see small movement and curious sound which you can't
quite make out. The tree branches sway softly while you decide your next

      <Description>Two lines of pixies and brownies stand facing one another yelling and
hooting in excitement. They seem to be deep in a game of 'Pixie, Brownie and
Honey Bun'. A small bag filled with pipeweed seed is placed squarely in the
middle of the line, while both teams are numbered off. A number is called,
and the respective brownie or pixie has to run forward, grab the bag and
return to the line without being touched. Looks like great fun.</Description>

and wonderful potions. The grand Pixie-Brownie Bonanza Festival seems up in
force, and there are no signs of it ending in the near future...</Description>

southernly turn here, making further travel to the west difficult if not

hacking through the notoriously resilient trees of the Emerald Forest. A
tall tree with huge leafy branches branches stands here tempting you to take
a break and rest in it's shade.</Description>

      <Description>The forest path begins to dwindle here. It's obvious you've entered a
part of the forest seldom visited by anyone. You notice the richness of the
flora here, with a wider and thicker range of herbs growing in wild abandon
across the ground or in small cul-de-sacs formed at the roots of the oak
trees. You hear a rustle in the bushes, but staring intently without trying
to look too obvious, you notice nothing.</Description>

Swallows and Bluebirds fill the air with song and laughter, and you spy a
small red-breast Robin sitting motionless on a branch on one of the oak
trees. The serenity of this forest is amazing, you feel at peace and safe,
as though you just stepped into a fairy tale where the knights kill all the
trolls, and nobody stays hungry. It's hard not to day dream, walking here.</Description>

      <Name>The Tombstone</Name>
      <Description>There is something rather peculiar about this part of the Emerald Forest.
A small tombstone sits in the middle of a small clearing. Carved from a
white substance, it's shiny surface reflects what little sunlight that
manages to escape from the umbrella covering of trees surrounding the grave.
Freshly picked flowers lie at the foot of the tombstone, while strange
symbols are lovingly engraved on it. The strange thing is there are no paths
leading from or to the area, which would puzzle even the most observant elf
or ranger. Who would pick flowers for a lone grave and leave no evidence of
passing?</Description>

      <Name>The Wood-Path</Name>
      <Description>The Wood-path you're following gets more pronounced and used here, a
testimony that the Emerald Forest isn't populated (or at least explored and
travelled) only by it's original furry or buzzing citizens. Multi-coloured
flowers dance gaily in the wind while clinging to the feet of the tall oak
and pine trees flanking the forest road. Flying squirrels leap from branch
to branch, probably searching for a delicious cashew or two.</Description>

      <Name>Woodkeeper's Clearing</Name>
      <Description>The path ends in a medium sized clearing. A small wooden sign states
quite dogmatically "WoodKeeper's Clearing. Forest haters not welcomed. Orcs,
Bugbears and Goblins keep out!" . A number of elves and humans dressed in a
mixture of green and brown stand around here engaging in friendly
conversation. The actual Keeper's Meet hasn't started yet, apparently there
are rangers from distant woodlands still trying to make it for the meeting.
A pile of scrolls sit on a small table, probably pamphlets to be distributed
to the arriving participants of the meeting.</Description>

      <Name>The Green Vines</Name>
      <Description>Thick green vines form an impossible barrier to the south. There is no
reason to doubt that these vines possess the same ability to block even the
most determined machete-armed lumber-dwarf then all the others. What does
seem a bit strange, however, are faint footsteps leading up to the vines and
abruptly stopping. Could they merely be tracks from an age past, now lost to
the world and found only in time and memory?</Description>

      <Name>The Silent Grove</Name>
      <Description>You've managed to wander into a small silent grove in the forest. For
some strange reason most of the forest noises seem to have disappeared,
though you can feel the rustle of the leaves beneath your feet as you walk.
The silence isn't really eerie, however, but more of a contemplative
quietness. Small stones are arranged in an odd fashion on the ground, much
the way seating chairs would be arranged should the speaker be in the middle
of a circle. It's almost as though a little tribe of beavers just had a
river-dam guild meeting and have left for lunch.</Description>

mountain face blocks any further exploring to the south and east, while the

rotting scent seems to come from it as most logs would emit.</Description>

      <Name>The Wood Area</Name>
      <Description>The trail leading south from here starts sloping downward into a richer
wood area. The undisturbed nature of the flora suggests that this is a
rarely travelled part of the forest even by it's own standards. A small
mouse-deer runs across the trail, followed by a lazy looking lynx. To the
north you can just make out a clearing through the trees, and there seems to
be movement.</Description>

      <Description>Standing here at the south-west end of the Brownie-Pixie Bonanza
Festival, your senses are quickly overloaded with sight, sound and smell.
Brownies clad in soft brown cloth with little feathered hats mingle happily
with their slightly smaller and greener cousins, the forest pixies. An
almost musical chitter-chatter fills the air, while the aroma of freshly
baked treats drift in from the north. There seems to be a forest dweller's
competition, what with the many games the pixies and brownies seem to be
playing. A tug of war is currently in progress, with the heaving Brownies
having a slight lead over the grunting Pixies.</Description>

shade of which some revellers have taken to rest. A lone thrush sighs from a
branch of the tree. To the west a trail slopes gently down.</Description>

bodyguard regiment of apples, peaches, raspberries and cookies. The dozens
of eager eaters seem a bit impatient, apparently this year's Bonanza
Chairman (or Grand Pooh-ba) hasn't opened the ceremony yet.</Description>

see. The terrain belows seems mostly rock and stone and has spare
vegetation. You can just make out a small path heading roughly to the east
through a cluster of bushes and trees.</Description>

      <Description>You've managed to stumble into an oriental home. A small wooden hut sits
to the south of a garden lovingly nurtured with blooming yellow, white and
red flower blossoms. Two stone lions sit on wooden pillars guarding entrance
to the garden, while two jade dragons guard the door to the hut proper. A
small bucket pulled well stands next to a pen of chickens and ducks who
cluck and quack away merrily. Carrots, cabbages and rice are grown in a
medium sized plot of land to the north. There is a small rock pool to the
east.</Description>

      <Description>You've entered a very peaceful part of the mystic's home. A crystal clear
pool sits here with large smooth pebbles neatly arranged all around it's
circumference. Peering into the pool, the unmoving mirror like surface of
the water reflect your image. There is no way of knowing exactly how deep
the pool is, but it must be very deep since you can't see the bottom. There
is a small wooden bench here beckoning you to sit and rest for a while, and
ponder things you've put aside, and think on matters you've forgotten.</Description>

kitchen is to the south of here. The spartan furniture, tidiness and simple
basic furniture hint at the occupier's character. There is a beautiful
painting of a young oriental women dressed in long flowing silk on one of
the walls. Parchments with foreign exotic wordings in flowing black ink
script sit on a desk. A small book catches your eye, it's title being "Zhuge
Liang's Chinese-Orthosi Dictionary". Some of the scrolls here are written in

      <Description>Tangled vines of ivy hang down from what remains of the arch-entranced of
this small monastery. It is ruined beyond repair and seems to have been
abandoned many years ago. There is a quiet and melancholic silence in the
air. You notice footprints in the dust that lead west into a leaf-strewn
courtyard and continue into a small chapel. You notice for the first time
that that area of the monastery seems to have been spared the dereliction
that the rest of the monastery has fallen into.</Description>

      <Description>You stand within the only standing structure of the once proud Monastery.
Evidently the chapel is looked after for the floors are swept, pews wiped
and the stained-glass windows in good working order. A modest pulpit made of
mahogany with a carved pine cross attached to it faces a few rows of wooden
benches. Probably cared for by questing paladins or clerics on a pilgrimage,
you wonder if any of the faithful might be nearby. To the west wall you see
a hole large enough for you to squeeze through.</Description>

within a monastery. Birdsong fills the air while butterflies yellow and red
flutter about happily. A tall large oak brings shade further west, but all
movement to the north and south is prevented by a combination of trees and
the old stone walls of the monastery. There is a serenity and a sense of
life and peace, hinting that it is often used by others as a place of
worship or contemplation.</Description>

      <Description>You walk into a much smaller room filled with sculptures instead of small
ornaments: over a hundred of them, lining the walls in holographic niches as
well as scattered around the floor on ornate pedestals. The variety, as you
have come to expect, is astonishing, ranging from human-style chunks of
simple stone and wood to others that were more like tethered living
creatures than works of art. Each is illuminated by a flaming blood candle,
giving a sharp contrast to the darkness around. You can barely make out a
huge bed that lies in the northeast corner of this gloomy room. Several
other portals seem to lead out of this room. You wonder where they may lead
to...</Description>

you, her brown eyes full of innocence and curiosity. As you approach her she
looks startled and disappears into the tree, only to appear on the other
side of it moments later to smile at you shyly. The dryad is just slightly
taller than 5 feet and has the eternally beautiful and youthful features of
the faerie folk.</description>

doesn't seem to be the selfish or suspicious sort but the friendly, "Come in

doesn't have many strangers and so they are largely spared the tricksters or
thieves of the larger towns. Her basket is full of delicious looking apples
and pears.</description>

      <description>This poor unfortunate fool has been left to wander around the village.
His brains are addled and he seems quite oblivious to your presence. He is
singing a song over and over again and you catch its words... "As I wander'd
the forest The green leaves among I heard a wild flower Singing a song: I
slept in the earth In the silent night I murmur'd my fears And I felt
delight. In the morning I went As rosy as morn To seek for new Joy But I met
with scorn"</description>

praying. He is dressed in the battle mail of the Crusader knights, which

Sorrow. Famed fighters and honourable men, they have one nagging trait.. All
of them seem full of sorrow and sadness all year round. It's not the sort of
whining self-flagellation type insecurity or self-pity, but a strange and
deep "sorrow" which they all seem burdened with. The Sorrow of God, perhaps?
Nobody really knows save the members of the order.</description>

activities of the Pixie-Brownie Bonanza. Not believed to exist by most of
the normal folk of Orthos, he is clad in soft green leathers and cloth and
wears a small cap with a proud rooster feather sticking out. Not looking at
them directly, he seems to be eyeing one of the brownies.</description>

      <description>A young man dressed in superb leather armour and green stands here,
longbow strapped comfortably over his back and a longsword by his side. He
has dark black hair, and has features which are both kind and handsome while
lacking in weakness. He notices you and smiles, while continues tending to a
small deer which seems to have injured it's leg.</description>

          <Description>It's one of the Bard's... "O me! What eyes hath Love put in my head,
Which have no correspondence with true sight; Or, if they have, where is my
judgement fled, That censures falsely what they see aright? If that be fair
whereon my false eyes dote, What means the world to say it is not so? If it
be not, then love doth well denote Love's eye is not so true as all men's:
no. How can it? O! How can Love's eye be true, That is so vex'd with
watching and with tears? No marvel then, though I mistake my view; The sun
itself sees not till heaven clears. O cunning love! With tears thou keep'st
me blind, Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find." You feel like
throwing it away.</Description>

          <Description>This small black bible looks well thumbed and has a weathered binding.
One of the bibles used by chapel-goers of the past, it seems to have
survived time, dust and wind. A small name seems to have been written neatly
on the top right hand corner of the first page, you can just make out
'Sebastian' on it.</Description>
