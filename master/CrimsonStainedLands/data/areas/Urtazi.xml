      <Name>Before a massive cave, on the mountainside</Name>
      <Description>Barely managing to climb the enormous mountainside, you seem to stumble
on to a large creation, set in cold stone. Before you is a magnificent
sight, a massive hole has been torn into the rock face of this mountain,
forming a dark cave. The foliage which surrounds the mountain seems to be
parted and destroyed around the cave, giving it an eerie, bare appearance.</Description>

      <Name>Within a slightly-lit cave</Name>
      <Description>Small rays of sunlight beam in from the south, shedding light to a small
portion of the cave. The rocks here range from a smooth gray to a slightly
dusted black color. Though not a single drop of moisture can be seen along
the walls. The ground below your feet is rather rough, it is quite obvious
that few, if any men, have passed through here recently. The tunnel
continues to the north, and exits to the south.</Description>

      <Description>It's pitch-black in here, and the only faint bit of light you can see,
shines from the south. The rocks are almost undetectable, but carry the
same texture and color, a smooth pale gray, to a dusted almost coal color.
Not a drop of moisture can be seen as these tunnels look very bare. The
tunnel continues to the north and south.</Description>

      <Name>Before a small intersection, within a dark cave</Name>
      <Description>Not a strand of light is here, though you begin to feel as though you
are being watched in the cold, dark cave. At times, you seem to hear a
whisper or chuckle, though it all sounds so faint, that it seems like your
mind is playing tricks on you. The rocks around here are a bit darker in
shade then the one's seen before the entrance of the cave. As you feel the
cold, rock surface, you seem to spot a small marking on the wall of the rock
face, it's small in design, below it point two arrows, one to the east, and
the other to the west.</Description>

hideous cavern. Towards the south the faint sound of chuckling and laughter

      <Description>Creeping further into the hideous cavern, you notice that the imps seem
to have no care in all of Shadar about their appearance. Filthy, smug grins
seem to be permanently plastered to their small, petite faces. Though, they
obviously lack the morale, and spirit to do anything about you invading
their privacy. The cavern continues to the north and east.</Description>

      <Description>Stumbling through the rocks in the wall, you manage to find yourself
before a dark passage, in the caves. Obviously man-made, the ground is
paved well, stretching north, for at least a few leagues. The rocks around
here, are squared and well-kempt, carrying a smooth texture, and a lovely,
granite color. The faint sound of footsteps can be heard all around you.
The passage continues to the north.</Description>

louder to the north, it's as though something very large is here. The

western side of the passage are broken and cracked. Humidity is very fierce
around this part of the passage. The passage continues to the north, and

stone litter the ground, though unlike the dark stones seen earlier, these
