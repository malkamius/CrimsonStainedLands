      <Name>Outside the Gate of the Goblin Village</Name>
      <Description>You are in a dimly lit clearing in a dense forest, surrounded by tall trees
and thick undergrowth. In the center of the clearing is a large iron gate,
guarded by two fierce-looking goblins with scowling expressions. The air is
thick with the smell of damp earth and rotting leaves, and the only sounds
are the rustling of leaves and the occasional hoot of an owl</Description>

      <Name>Inside the Goblin Village</Name>
      <Description>This is a chaotic and eerie place, filled with strange noises and foul
smells. The village is a maze of ramshackle huts made from scraps of wood
and metal, with twisted pathways snaking between them. Goblins of all
shapes and sizes scurry around, shouting at each other in their guttural
language and causing a general commotion. The ground is slick with slime
and mud, and strange creatures lurk in the shadows, their glowing eyes
watching from the darkness. In the center of the village is a tall totem
pole decorated with crude symbols and bones, signifying the goblins'
devotion to their dark gods.</Description>

      <Description>Outside this goblin hut, the air is thick with the smell of rotting meat
and dirty fur. The hut itself is small and made of rough-hewn wood and
scraps of metal, barely standing upright. A single door, crudely carved
from a slab of bark, creaks in the wind, inviting those brave enough to
enter. The ground around the hut is littered with bones and scraps of food,
evidence of the goblins' voracious appetite. From inside the hut, strange
noises can be heard, like the hiss of a snake and the muffled screeches of
small creatures.</Description>

      <Name>Inside a goblin hut</Name>
      <Description>A goblin hut is a small, crudely-built dwelling. It is made of dirt, stone,
and scavenged wood, metal and other stuff. The hut itself is small and cramped,
with a low ceiling, and just one room that serves as both living and sleeping quarters.
The interior of the hut is dimly lit, with little to no natural light coming through,
and the air is musty and damp. The goblin's possessions are cluttered and strewn about,
including weapons, tools, and undoubtedly, stolen goods. The furniture is makeshift and
uncomfortable.</Description>

      <Description>This is a chaotic and eerie place, filled with strange noises and foul
smells. The village is a maze of ramshackle huts made from scraps of wood
and metal, with twisted pathways snaking between them. Goblins of all
shapes and sizes scurry around, shouting at each other in their guttural
language and causing a general commotion. The ground is slick with slime
and mud, and strange creatures lurk in the shadows, their glowing eyes
watching from the darkness. In the center of the village is a tall totem
pole decorated with crude symbols and bones, signifying the goblins'
devotion to their dark gods.</Description>

scraps of metal, barely standing upright. A single door, crudely carved
from a slab of bark, creaks in the wind, inviting those brave enough to
enter. The ground around the hut is littered with bones and scraps of food,
evidence of the goblins' voracious appetite. From inside the hut, strange
noises can be heard, like the hiss of a snake and the muffled screeches of
small creatures.</Description>

and scavenged wood, metal and other stuff. The hut itself is small and cramped,
with a low ceiling, and just one room that serves as both living and sleeping quarters.
The interior of the hut is dimly lit, with little to no natural light coming through,
and the air is musty and damp. The goblin's possessions are cluttered and strewn about,
including weapons, tools, and undoubtedly, stolen goods. The furniture is makeshift and
uncomfortable.</Description>

      <Name>A cave entrance in the Goblin Village</Name>
      <Description>The entrance to this cave in the Goblin Village is a foreboding sight. The
opening is narrow, and the jagged rocks that surround it seem to reach out
like grasping claws. The air is damp and musty, and the sound of dripping
water echoes from deep within. The walls of the cave are covered in strange
markings and symbols, drawn in what looks like dried blood. As you step
closer, you can hear the faint whispering of goblin voices, and the
occasional clanging of metal. The darkness inside is impenetrable, and it's
impossible to know what dangers await those who dare to venture inside.</Description>

      <Description>The walls are rough and uneven, made of natural rock formations, and the
ground is covered with a thin layer of dirt and debris. The cell itself is
made of rusted iron bars, separating the prisoner from the outside world.
The sounds from inside the cell are muffled, but the occasional groan or
whimper can be heard. The air inside the cell is musty and stale, and the
only light comes from a flickering torch mounted on the wall. The
atmosphere outside the prison cell is oppressive.</Description>

      <Name>Inside a prison cell</Name>
      <Description>Inside the prison cell, the air is thick with the smell of dampness and
decay. The walls are rough and uneven, made of cold, hard stone, and the
floor is littered with straw and dirt. The cell is small and cramped, with
rusted iron bars separating the prisoner from the outside world. The only
light comes from a small torch mounted on the wall, casting eerie shadows
on the rough stone walls. The air is cold and musty, and the sounds from
outside the cell are muffled and distant. The atmosphere inside the prison
cell is oppressive, with a feeling of hopelessness and despair that seems
to seep into every crevice.</Description>
