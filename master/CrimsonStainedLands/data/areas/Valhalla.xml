      <Name>The Center of the Universe</Name>
      <Description>The center of the universe is a place beyond description, where the laws of physics and reality as we know it no longer apply. The space is filled with an otherworldly radiance, a brilliant light in every color imaginable, pulsing with an energy that defies comprehension. Here, time seems to stand still, and the boundaries of space are blurred beyond recognition. The air is thick with an intangible essence, charged with the power of creation and boundless possibility. Exits to all 42 dimensions open before you, leading to every corner of the multiverse and beyond. The energy of this place is both calming and invigorating, filled with a sense of peace and infinite potential. Here, one feels as if they have reached the very heart of existence, a place where all things are possible and anything can be created with a single thought.</Description>

everything is strangely peaceful in here, with the sun shining in from above

A sudden blow: the great wings beating still
Above the staggering girl, her thighs carressed
By the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill,
he holds her helpless breast upon his breast.
How can those terrified vague fingers push
The feathered glory from her loosening thighs?
And how can body, laid in that white rush,
But feel that strange heart beating where it lies?
A shudder in the loins engenders there
The broken wall, the burning roof and tower
And Agammemnon dead.  Being so caught up,
So mastered by this brute blood of the air,
Did she put on his knowledge with his power
Before his indifferent beak could let her drop?</Description>

What sort of form was Hook showing?  Misguided man though he

the end he stayed true to the traditions of his race.  The
other boys were flying about him now, flouting, scornful; and
as he staggered about the deck striking at them impotently, his
mind was no longer with them; it was slouching in the playing
fields of long ago, or being sent up for good, or watching
the wall-game from a famous wall.  And his shoes were right,
and his waistcoat was right, and his tie was right, and his
socks were right.

If, that is to say, that I am bored with an adventure that has
claimed my attentions for four mortal months, it is not my fault.
If, that is to say, my love is equal to your virtue - and that
is certainly saying a great deal - it is not surprising that
one should come to the end at the same time as the other.  It
is not my fault.
A woman that I love madly now insists that I give you up for
her.  It is not my fault.
I quite realize that this is the perfect opportunity to accuse
me of perjury: but if, where nature has gifted men with no
more than constancy, she has given women obstinacy, it is
not my fault.
Believe this, you should take another lover, even as I take
another mistress.  This is good, very good advice: if you
find it bad, it is not my fault.
Good-bye, my angel.  I took you with pleasure, I leave you
without regret.  I shall come back perhaps.  Such is life.

          <Description>Welcome to the secret book of total POS domination. Count yourself lucky, people have 
killed for this information. Now read on and learn all you need to know.
Getting Started:
1. Right when you create, your should first type Outfit. This will give you a basic set
of armor to get started. Buying simple weapons, one south and up of the altar in
Mid should be your next stop. At the merchant, type LIST to show his wares..then simply
type BUY Dagger..etc..whichever weapon you wish, or purchase all of them if you want.
Congrats, you now have armor and weapons. Next type PRAC ALL, to practice all your skills,
spells, or sups to 75%. You are now ready to get on with the training. Look at pagetwo.</Description>

          <Description>2. Training and getting the lay of the land.
From market square in Midgaard, go one south, and three east to the sailor. It is here
you can train your health points or mana, or other stats. Simply type TRAIN there to see
how many training sessions you have and what you are able to spend them on. To Train them
type Train hp..or train mana..etc to improve your stats. Once you are out of trains that
is it..no more. If you have spare practices you can gain convert them. 10 pracs=one train
here. Be careful of spending your practice sessions though, you might need them further
down the road with cabal skills and the like. So you have armor and weapon and are trained.
If you wish to spend your three hours as a protected newbie practicing your skills in
a safe place, three west and three south, and one east of the market square in Midgaard
would be the place to start. This is only able to be accessed by newbies, and the dummy
does not hit that hard, so you will be able to practice parry, dodge..etc in relative
safety. It's also a good place to learn what your skills *actually* do, if you have any
questions on what a certain skill/spell/supplication does try looking to our helpfiles
for an answer. For instance..typing HELP shield will bring up all related topics to 
shields..helpful for newbie paladins. Onward you go! Doing well so far right?</Description>
