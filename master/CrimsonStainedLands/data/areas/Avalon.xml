      <Name>Edge of a Mangrove Swamp</Name>
      <Description>The mangrove forest extends to the edge of the water, where the ocean meets the shore. The tangled roots of the mangrove trees reach out into the water like a web of gnarled fingers, providing a home for a diverse array of marine life. The still waters of the mangrove swamp are dotted with islands of sand and mud, while schools of fish swim among the roots. The air is thick with the sounds of life, from the chirping of crickets to the calls of seabirds. The sea beyond the mangroves is calm and inviting, stretching out towards the horizon in a shimmering blue expanse. The boundary between land and sea is not a line, but a transition, with the mangroves serving as a bridge between the two realms.</Description>

      <Name>Wading in a Mangrove Swamp</Name>
      <Description>The mangrove swamp is a dense, tangled jungle of twisted roots and knee-high waters. The murky water is alive with a wealth of marine life, including crabs, shellfish, and schools of fish that dart amongst the roots. The twisted trunks of the mangrove trees rise up from the water, supporting a lush canopy of leaves and branches that provides a home to countless birds and other wildlife. Sunlight filters down through the leaves, dappling the water below with light and shadows. The air is thick with the hum of insects, the calls of birds, and the occasional splash of a fish or crab. Amidst the thicket of roots, it is easy to lose one's way.</Description>

The twisted trunks of the mangrove trees rise up from the water, supporting a lush canopy of leaves and branches that provides a home to countless birds and other wildlife. Sunlight filters down through the leaves, dappling the water below with light and shadows. The air is thick with the hum of insects, the calls of birds, and the occasional splash of a fish or crab. Amidst the thicket of roots, it is easy to lose one's way.</Description>

      <Name>Edge of a Mangrove Swamp</Name>
      <Description>The mangrove forest extends to the edge of the water, where the ocean meets the shore. The tangled roots of the mangrove trees reach out into the water like a web of gnarled fingers, providing a home for a diverse array of marine life. The still waters of the mangrove swamp are dotted with islands of sand and mud, while schools of fish swim among the roots. The air is thick with the sounds of life, from the chirping of crickets to the calls of seabirds. The sea beyond the mangroves is calm and inviting, stretching out towards the horizon in a shimmering blue expanse. The boundary between land and sea is not a line, but a transition, with the mangroves serving as a bridge between the two realms.</Description>

standing stone with a rude altar in front of it.  The altar is scattered
with various offerings; bread and flowers are strewn about the stones and

      <Name>Wading in a Mangrove Swamp</Name>
      <Description>The mangrove swamp is a dense, tangled jungle of twisted roots and knee-high waters. The murky water is alive with a wealth of marine life, including crabs, shellfish, and schools of fish that dart amongst the roots. The twisted trunks of the mangrove trees rise up from the water, supporting a lush canopy of leaves and branches that provides a home to countless birds and other wildlife. Sunlight filters down through the leaves, dappling the water below with light and shadows. The air is thick with the hum of insects, the calls of birds, and the occasional splash of a fish or crab. Amidst the thicket of roots, it is easy to lose one's way.</Description>

      <Name>Edge of a Mangrove Swamp</Name>
      <Description>The mangrove forest extends to the edge of the water, where the ocean meets the shore. The tangled roots of the mangrove trees reach out into the water like a web of gnarled fingers, providing a home for a diverse array of marine life. The still waters of the mangrove swamp are dotted with islands of sand and mud, while schools of fish swim among the roots. The air is thick with the sounds of life, from the chirping of crickets to the calls of seabirds. The sea beyond the mangroves is calm and inviting, stretching out towards the horizon in a shimmering blue expanse. The boundary between land and sea is not a line, but a transition, with the mangroves serving as a bridge between the two realms.</Description>

      <Name>Wading in a Mangrove Swamp</Name>
      <Description>The mangrove swamp is a dense, tangled jungle of twisted roots and knee-high waters. The murky water is alive with a wealth of marine life, including crabs, shellfish, and schools of fish that dart amongst the roots. The twisted trunks of the mangrove trees rise up from the water, supporting a lush canopy of leaves and branches that provides a home to countless birds and other wildlife. Sunlight filters down through the leaves, dappling the water below with light and shadows. The air is thick with the hum of insects, the calls of birds, and the occasional splash of a fish or crab. Amidst the thicket of roots, it is easy to lose one's way.</Description>

The murky water is alive with a wealth of marine life, including crabs, shellfish, and schools of fish that dart amongst the roots. The twisted trunks of the mangrove trees rise up from the water, supporting a lush canopy of leaves and branches that provides a home to countless birds and other wildlife. Sunlight filters down through the leaves, dappling the water below with light and shadows. The air is thick with the hum of insects, the calls of birds, and the occasional splash of a fish or crab. Amidst the thicket of roots, it is easy to lose one's way.</Description>

      <Description>You slog through the lake, which is waist deep at this point.  The water
is cold and soaks through your boots, chilling you.  You can hear the sounds
of large creatures moving through the water and look around nervously.  The
mist is thick here, with faint openings to the north and west.</Description>

      <Description>You emerge finally from the lake to find yourself on a trail leading
around the edge of the water.  The trail is muddy and uneven, and the mist
curls from the lake to wrap around your feet and remind you of the chilly
water.  The air is cool, and you can sense a faint tang of pine.</Description>

      <Description>The ground is becoming very marhy on this part of the trail, and water
from the lake begins to lap against your feet as you continue on.  The
footing is very treacherous here, and you clutch at a nearby tree as the
ground slides beneath you.  The forest around you is silent, and you can
faintly smell the scent of apples in the air.</Description>

you, awing you into silence.  The holy thorn grows here, that Joseph of
Arimathea planted when he came to those shores.  The holy thorn once
represented the oath that the christian priests would never rise against the
druids, who were at Avalon before them, but now that oath is broken. 
Faintly in the distance, as if in a dream, you think you can hear the sound
of church bells through the mist.</Description>

You hear a moaning coming from the tree, and draw closer nervously.  In the
cleft of the trunk, a human figure writhes in agony.  He reaches out one
clawlike hand towards you and whispers 'Mercy, oh have mercy."  You draw
back in alarm as you recognize Kevin, the false Merlin of Britain, who was
accused and found guilty of treason to the high priestess of Avalon, and to
the holy order of the druids.</Description>

      <Description>The private room of the gatekeeper of Avalon is an austere place, with
only a hard bunk, chest, and small table gracing the room.  The walls are of
a dark grey stone, and a small brazier rests on the table, barely warming
the chill in the air.  The gatekeeper herself sits by the table, spinning
only a hard bunk, chest, and small table gracing the room.  The walls are of
wool.</Description>

Acolytes and priestesses pass by you on their way to their errands, and
there is a a faint murmur to be heard throughout the house.  The rustle of
robes blends in with the faint murmuring and creates a very peaceful
atmosphere.  Rooms lie to the north and south, and the hallway continues
east and west.</Description>

          <Description>Dearest Sister,
Please let us put aside all our differences, and strive to reconcile this rift that
has come between us.  I am willing to forgive you your treasonous behaviour
with Accolon, but I must demand that you remove your son from my halls
and bid him accept that he can never be king of these lands.  I also must
insist that you return back to me Excalibur, which is my sword, by divine
right.
Arthur, Pendragon of Britain.</Description>
