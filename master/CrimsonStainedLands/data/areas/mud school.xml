room are: north, south, east, west, up, or down.  Of course, not all rooms
have all exits available.

if you bump into a door.
Try going into each direction from here.  When you are done, go NORTH.</Description>

          <Description>Welcome to combat training.
The first lesson is knowing whom to fight.  Use the command 'CONSIDER' to
consider killing a monster.  Avoid fighting monsters that will kill you
easily.
The second lesson is running away.  There is a monster in the room down.
He is too strong for you to kill, but he won't kill you.  So go 'DOWN' from
here, then 'CONSIDER' him, then 'KILL' him.  After a while, type 'FLEE' to
escape from him.
You can also set your character to flee automatically with the 'WIMPY' command.
Type 'HELP WIMPY' to find out more about 'WIMPY'.
After you flee, you will be back in this room.  When you are ready to go on
to the next station, go 'WEST'.</Description>

          <Description>Welcome to the cage room.  The adepts of mud school have captured some
monsters for you to kill.  In the four cages are four monsters of various
types.  Kill them all!
After you kill each monster, get all of the equipment from their corpses
with the command 'GET ALL CORPSE'.  You can then use the command 'WEAR ALL'
to wear your newly won equipment.
When you are done with the corpse, 'SACRIFICE CORPSE' to give it to your God.
God will reward you for this.
Between combat, you may need to rest or sleep to regenerate hit points.
You can 'REST' to regenerate hit points, or you can 'SLEEP'.  'SLEEP' will
refresh you faster than 'REST', but you will be less aware of your
surroundings.</Description>

Go 'NORTH' from here to visit our arena.  There are plenty of low-level
monsters, but DON'T attack other players.
If you want to go directly back to the temple at any time, type 'RECALL'.
Don't forget to type save to protect your character.  You won't be saved after
quitting until you reach level 2, so also type save before you type quit.
If you need more help during the game, type 'HELP'.  If you see something
wrong or have comments, use 'BUG', 'IDEA', or 'TYPO' to report them.
May your visit here be ... mercenary.</Description>

and to build confidence in their abilities, before moving on to more
challenging places with stronger monsters. A variety of "wimpy" monsters
make their home here, waiting for someone to come kill them. The stone floors
here are rough and the lighting is dim.</Description>

the floors are all covered with slime.  A feeling of dread comes over you as
you notice that this is NOT a great place to go.  Exits go in all directions.
Of special note is the one that brings you back up!!!</Description>
