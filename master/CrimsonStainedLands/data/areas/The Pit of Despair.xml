      <Name>A downward spiral</Name>
      <Description>You are standing on a small spiral staircase leading down into the 
blackness. The edges of the pit are jagged and charred by some sort of 
intense fire. Looking around you can see that some small bits of fire allow 
a little illumination as the stairs go deeper into the ground.</Description>

      <Name>A dimly lit corridor</Name>
      <Description>On the first level of this pit, you can see that many people have
used this place before, but no one can be seen around in the
hallways. In the distance you can hear the sounds of clanking metal,
whips, and muffled screams. On the floor you can see where people have 
scuffed away the once smooth stone walkways leaving only a mixture of
dirt and crushed rock. The walls on both sides show a series of iron
rings caked in dried blood.</Description>

      <Description>On the first level of this pit, you can see that many people have
used this place before, but no one can be seen around in the
hallways. In the distance you can hear the sounds of clanking metal,
whips, and muffled screams. On the floor you can see where people have 
scuffed away the once smooth stone walkways leaving only a mixture of
dirt and crushed rock. The walls on both sides show a series of iron
rings caked in dried blood.</Description>

      <Description>On the first level of this pit, you can see that many people have
used this place before, but no one can be seen around in the
hallways. In the distance you can hear the sounds of clanking metal,
whips, and muffled screams. On the floor you can see where people have 
scuffed away the once smooth stone walkways leaving only a mixture of
dirt and crushed rock. The walls on both sides show a series of iron
rings caked in dried blood.</Description>

used this place before, but no one can be seen around in the
hallways. In the distance you can hear the sounds of clanking metal,
whips, and muffled screams. On the floor you can see where people have 
scuffed away the once smooth stone walkways leaving only a mixture of
dirt and crushed rock. The walls on both sides show a series of iron
rings caked in dried blood.</Description>

      <Description>The air here is almost too foul for you too breathe in without vomiting. 
Unlike the level above, this place looks like a slaughter house. Remains of 
unfortunate prisoners line the walls and floors like a gruesome type of 
decoration. The screams are clear now and coming from all directions. Men,
women, and children are yelling out pleads for mercy yet they are answered
only with more pain.  To the east you see a door covered in bars and
magical runes.</Description>

      <Description>The air here is almost too foul for you too breathe in without vomiting. 
Unlike the level above, this place looks like a slaughter house. Remains of 
unfortunate prisoners line the walls and floors like a gruesome type of 
decoration. The screams are clear now and coming from all directions. Men,
women, and children are yelling out pleads for mercy yet they are answered
only with more pain.  To the west you see a large door with no windows.</Description>

      <Name>Madhatter's private room</Name>
      <Description>This room is much larger than the other prison rooms you have seen around 
this place. Also, this room is covered in psychadelic hues of red and orange 
with exotic flowers all around. A special rack lies in the center of the 
room with a series of wenches and pulleys connected by razor edged wire. 
Small embers of fire can be seen underneath the table itself giving the
person participating on the table a warm and cozy feeling. Weapons of all
types line the walls all showing years and years of use. On one side the
room is a series of hooks in the wall used for hanging up whatever the
Madhatter desires.  Currently the majority of them are holding hats as
well as heads.</Description>
