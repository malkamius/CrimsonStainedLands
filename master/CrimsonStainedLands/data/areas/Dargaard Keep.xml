      <Name>A trail leading up the mountain</Name>
      <Description>Up this side trail through the Vingaard Mountains, elevation increases
slowly but steadily, so little that you are not quite going up the mountain,
but enough so that you're not on a hillside. You can't see too well to the
east, but something is up there ... Something that you can feel here. Cold
fog and mist blankets the ground, condensing on your armor, chilling you
more than it should. It is, after all, just mist. Maybe there's a place that
you can rest up ahead. Back west lie the mountains.</Description>

      <Name>Before a stone keep</Name>
      <Description>You stand before a mighty fortress of cold, hard grey stone. A feeling of
dread and chill overtakes you upon looking at its tall spires and high
fortifications. A large wooden door is the only visible entrance into this
keep. Wind howls all about, cold wind mixed with cold rain. It beats on your
skin mercilessly. Overhead, the sky darkens and thunder rolls in the
distance. And you notice that there are very few footprints in the dusty
soil of the Vingaard mountains here; only deep, heavy impressions in the
ground and some fairly gaunt-looking steps, as if a creature with bony feet
walked here. Back west, the trail through the Vingaard mountains goes back
to what feels much safer.</Description>

      <Name>Foyer of Dargaard Keep</Name>
      <Description>Horror. Destruction. Hate. Nothing else can shove its way into your mind.
This is Dargaard Keep, or it was. How long has it stood undiscovered? Cries
echo across the ruins. They sound unearthly and undead, and you get the
distinct feeling that he is here ... Lord Soth. Damned by his elven wife as
the Cataclysm struck Krynn to wander the realm in an eternal, dreadful life
in this very place ... The man who was once the bravest and most honorable
Solamnic Knight, now cursed to unlife until Krynn is destroyed again. To the
west, regardless of what may be there, it is much safer, in the Vingaard
mountains, even in the dark. Up here, nobody can hear you scream. Nobody can
come help you. Nobody will find your body. Up here all alone, let alone in
the dark.</Description>

      <Description>Footsteps echo faintly in the distant, narrow stone halls of the Keep. An
insubstantial shadow moves before you, brushing your cheek, freezing it for
a moment or two. Cries echo in the night, torches flicker eerie bluish-white
light all about the keep, casting shadows that look like they're moving ...
Or are they doing that on their own? The darkness overwhelms you when you
look at one of them, lancing your eyes and stabbing into your skull. Back
west, where it's safe, no matter what lies there, is the Vingaard mountain
range. North, south and east, the halls stretch on, stretching on when you
look at them.</Description>

and paintings. Torches burn mysteriously, lighting the hall with blue-white
flame. A strange mist hangs low to the floor, chilling your legs as you walk
through it. It seems to exist on its own volition. A coldness fills the air,
an unnatural coldness; it is like the coldness of death. Cries echo through
the ruins of the stone keep. They sound sad and mournful, singing a
terrifyingly beautiful song in an elven voice. The hall looms on to the
east, and the entrance to the keep is west.</Description>

      <Name>Second floor landing</Name>
      <Description>At the top of the main stair, no fog floats low to the ground. It is
replaced by a mist that takes no notice of the solidarity of the world or of
itself, it only clings to anything that it can, then moves on, like a cat
that is restless and wandering about for no reason other than to keep moving
at all costs. From in the shadows it crawls, and in the shadows it finds a
way to go where it wants to go. To the west the passage extends, trying not
to collapse under the psychic emotional pressure that forces it to stand
beyond time, beyond life, beyond anything that is natural and good. And down
lies the first floor, down lies the fog that clutches to your legs like a
small lost child.</Description>

and paintings. Torches burn mysteriously, lighting the hall with blue-white
flame. A strange mist hangs low to the floor, chilling your legs as you walk
through it. It seems to exist on its own volition. A coldness fills the air,
an unnatural coldness; it is like the coldness of death. Cries echo through
the ruins of the stone keep. They sound sad and mournful, singing a
terrifyingly beautiful song in an elven voice. The hall looms on to the
west. North and south, another hallway extends ominously, and to the east
seems to be a dining hall.</Description>

      <Name>Second floor hallway</Name>
      <Description>The second floor is colder than the first, and the fog is strangely gone.
In its place is an odd sort of ether in the air, a few wisps of it here and
there. The torches on the wall light the grey stone hallways in an odd sort
of blue-white light, one that gives off no heat, only light. A few
tapestries line the walls, with the occasional painting that must have been
done by an artist well-known in his time. No windows are in this hall, no
sign of life graces the floor. The only thing here is the feel of death, of
fear, of something ancient and ageless. You can hear or discern anything
about the outside world, as if it did not exist at this point in time.</Description>

      <Description>This is a dreamscape, something not real, something time should have
forgotten about but couldn't. Bolted footsteps seem to follow you, but
nothing is there to see, nothing is there to make those sounds of pensive
walking and pondering. Life is just a dream of the waking, a dream long
forgotten about in these halls of madness and sorrow. Mists wrap around
nothing, float in some sort of twisted purpose through the air and through
the silent stony walls of the hall. To the south lies the rest of this wing
of the keep, and to the north is another hallway of dreams altogether.</Description>

      <Description>In this hallway, screams echo too loudly, footsteps echo too near to you.
Things seem too loud to be real, things are too mysterious and intangible to
be here. There is no life save your own, no breathing but yours, nothing
here that would make anything comfortable. Darkness settles in and makes its
home here, mists trail through the air and through the walls. Great sadness
and pain assail your mind, burning an image of lost love, of lost goodness
and light. Torches burn blue, burning without heat or purpose other than to
give an inkling of what life once was. South, another wing of the keep
extends, and north is the rest of this part.</Description>

      <Description>You stand at the top of a short staircase that links the first and second
floors. The stairs wind down from here, illuminated by a few smokeless
torches that bestow an odd blue light over the area. The second floor
hallway leads south from this point. The fog that was so prominent on the
first floor is gone now, and only a few wisps of some ethereal material
float through the air and the walls. The air has grown colder on this floor,
and it is somewhat harder to breathe here, probably because of whatever is
in the air.</Description>

growing dark with night, you feel somehow at peace. A haunting song echoes
in the distance somewhere, a song sung by elven voices to Lord Soth. You can
see most of the Vingaard mountains from here, and looking straight down, you
can see the main gate of the keep. You might even be able to jump down
there; it can't be more than a 15 foot fall. Back east, the keep reaches on,
cold and dark. And somewhere, the undead elven maidens sing to Lord Soth all
night long.</Description>

      <Description>Choices overwhelm you here, just like the overwhelming feel of hate on
this, the third floor. North, south, east and west lie cold stone hallways,
up and down lie imposingly wide staircases that lead to old places consumed
by old tradition and the pain of a time when something good dwelled here.
Now there is nothing ... Nothing. Only memories of a warm hearth, of life
and love that cannot exist here anymore. They were forced out when death and
corruption were forced in. It doesn't take much to rip the air, thick as it
is with a cramped longing for a glimpse of the grand bastion of light that
it once was.</Description>

      <Name>Northern hallway</Name>
      <Description>You are north of the center of the floor, where halls converge and then
split apart again. Energies seem to streak through the halls here, strange
mists materialize and dissipate before you can focus your eyes on them. The
mists sometimes have faces in them, faces of horror and pain and screaming
agony. The walls have the same emotions, the same feelings; they were never
allowed to fall during the Cataclysm, but were forced to stand and become
something that they shouldn't have been. Nothing is right; the hallways
seems to almost rotate and twist before your eyes, but when you blink, all
is right again for a time.</Description>

something walks, but you cannot see it. You are being trailed by something

down your throat with every inhale that you take. It chokes you, forcing you
to fight for your own life even when you are not fighting. No one dared, no

      <Description>In this short hallway, you get a feeling of more comfort than you have
felt in the rest of the keep, but it is still hateful towards you and it
decidedly wants you to leave now. Here, you get the feeling that the Keep
itself is alive, given life by the intensely evil presence that occupies it.
Rather, perhaps the Keep is undead, like all that is inside it. Regardless,
you are unwanted and despised. The Keep is a mystery of time and of the
realm, something filled with knowledge held only by Gilean.</Description>

      <Description>You are between two large doors of thick oak, one north and one south.
The hallway is back to the east. This area of the keep feels more
comfortable for some reason; it feels lived in. That's the only real way to
describe it; not as much ill will and hatred is here as compared to the rest
of the Keep. But still, something is wrong, something is terribly hateful
and discordiant. The spirits of the old seem to be pushing you away because
you are something alive and you have that spark of life in you, and that is
something that is foreign, fearful and unwanted here.</Description>

of the hallway stretches out to the west. When compared to the rest of the
Keep, this hallway almost feels comfortable. Severe regret and pain emanate
from the east, from behind the large oaken door. And when compared to the
rest of the Keep, it almost doesn't register with you at all, since it feels
so much less worse here. But lest you forget, you are in the fortress of the
eternally damned Lord Soth, who commands an army of the undead. And you are
alive, which is more odious than anything else to the inhabitants of this
bastion of hate and death.</Description>

soaks the first floor is here now, somehow flowing inside the room but not
out of the door. It latches onto you, weighing you down and wanting to drag
you into the floor and crush you from the ankles up, grinding you until you
are nothing more than a mass of bone and gore on the floor, energies of
death to be sucked up by the mist and reinforce the powers of Dargaard Keep
and of Lord Soth. Comfort would be here were it not for the mist that hates
you so, it is something alien and not of this world, somehow stemming from
the Abyss to this realm but not back again.</Description>

      <Description>Inside this grey dining hall, one that used to be draped with fine
tapestries and banners of the Knights of Solamnia, you get the feeling of
nostalgia, then hate. The old wooden table still stretches down most of the
length of this great hall, and it is still set with silver plates, goblets,
candelabras, and utensils. What used to be the finest linen is used as a
tablecloth. Now, there's no telling what kind of feasts are held here, or
what is drunk from those fine silver goblets. A chill fills the air and
flows all around you. The mist present in the main hall isn't as thick as it
is here.</Description>

      <Description>The mist is still missing from the fourth floor of the Keep. The halls
echo strange voices in the night, strange faces by the day. It is as a dream
that never ends, a dream that you can't wake up from. The undead citizens of
this fortress all roam about in the same manner, all convinced that they are
merely dreaming and that you are but a figure in the dream, perhaps sharing
the same dream. Below you, the stairwell is dark, but to the east and west,
the now-familiar blue-white glow of the cold torches lights the halls and
shadows things in a way that doesn't seem quite right. And all about, the
same elven song travels lightly on the dark air.</Description>

      <Name>Before a long staircase</Name>
      <Description>Just east of the waiting hall lies this staircase, so long that you
cannot see the top of it. Thick fog rolls down it, like some sort of twisted
waterfall, cold and evil, glowing with an unearthly white light and further
illuminated by the blue glow of the torches that line the halls and give no
warmth, just light. A heavy, resonant moaning can be heard from up above,
but no sign is here as to its source. The entire stairwell is dark, and the
light only penetrates a few feet up the staircase. A feeling of evil washes
over the room as silence falls suddenly, as a portent of doom like the
flaming mountain cast down upon the city of Istar.</Description>

      <Name>On the staircase</Name>
      <Description>All is dark, and you can see nothing above or below. No torches line
these walls, no heat is felt here. The temperature causes your breath to
crystallize heavily on the air and fall to the floor to be joined with the
thick fog that rolls down the staircase and up your legs, tendrils of it
grasping at anything that it can latch onto. It seems to not be inhibited by
the walls or by you, going right through anything in its way like an evil
nightfall from which the sun will never rise again, in which the three moons
will never be seen. The evil emanations from up above almost grab you by the
neck and throttle the life out of you.</Description>

      <Description>You stand before a great set of iron doors, bolted firmly to the stone
wall. Below you lies the impressively grand stairwell. Cold air flows all
about you, mist rising from the floor only to melt again in the frigid air.
Here especially is the atmosphere fearful and evil, here it is cold and
shivering. And out of the shadows, a pair of eyes watches you, watches your
every move, watches the fear, the cold, the panic in you, in your soul. Your
limbs grow stiff and your entire body is caught in spasms of quaking of
cold. There is but a single torch above the doorway to the east, causing
shadows to flicker about uncontrollably.</Description>

Things seem too loud to be real, things are too mysterious and intangible to
be here. There is no life save your own, no breathing but yours, nothing
here that would make anything comfortable. Darkness settles in and makes its
home here, mists trail through the air and through the walls. Great sadness
and pain assail your mind, burning an image of lost love, of lost goodness
and light. Torches burn blue, burning without heat or purpose other than to
give an inkling of what life once was.</Description>

      <Description>In this hallway, screams echo too loudly, footsteps echo too near to you.
Things seem too loud to be real, things are too mysterious and intangible to
be here. There is no life save your own, no breathing but yours, nothing
here that would make anything comfortable. Darkness settles in and makes its
home here, mists trail through the air and through the walls. Great sadness
and pain assail your mind, burning an image of lost love, of lost goodness
and light. Torches burn blue, burning without heat or purpose other than to
give an inkling of what life once was. East and west, short halls lie. South
is the rest of this wing.</Description>

nothing is there to see, nothing is there to make those sounds of pensive
walking and pondering. Life is just a dream of the waking, a dream long
forgotten about in these halls of madness and sorrow. Mists wrap around
nothing, float in some sort of twisted purpose through the air and through
the silent stony walls of the hall. To the south lies the rest of this wing
of the keep, and to the north is another hallway of dreams altogether.</Description>

the cold stone that was mined, shaped and fitted together to form this

laughter and peace, but now ... Nothing. You are the only sign of life in
this hall, everything else is a mere shadow of reality. Mist clings to the
air and passes through the walls as if they were not there. The door to the
east is silent, the hall to the west is quiet. Anything here is just a
picture of the past, a picture of a life long forgotten in the realm of life
and love. This is the realm of death and hate, of a fall from a grace so
high that only one punishment could fit the crime.</Description>

in design; overall, very spartan. A window shows a glimpse of the outside
world, and a small lamp that is beside the chair gives light to the room,
the same eerie blue light that fills the rest of the halls here. This must
have been one of Lord Soth's favorite rooms when he was alive, as it has a
very comfortable feel to it at times ... However, this is not one of those
times. Now the room is mysteriously colder than the rest of the hallways, as
if you were not wanted here.</Description>

blown off by the chill wind that pours in through the window. Something here

      <Description>In this, the Great Hall, you feel nothing but absolute terror and hate
literally flowing from the walls in the form of the white fog that is so
thick and cold on the ground that there is a real danger of your feet and
legs going numb and you will be left to crawl away from the Keep, to be at
the mercy of the undead minions that dwell here. Great tapestries line the
walls, enormous paintings are mixed with them. You are not wanted here, you
are not needed here, and whatever the driving force behind the thick fog it
will do its best to drag you down into it and leave you there to die and
then undie, to become just another horrible creature of the night and to
terrify children in their sleep at the mere thought of you.</Description>

      <Description>In this, the Great Hall, you feel nothing but absolute terror and hate
literally flowing from the walls in the form of the white fog that is so
thick and cold on the ground that there is a real danger of your feet and
legs going numb and you will be left to crawl away from the Keep, to be at
the mercy of the undead minions that dwell here. Great tapestries line the
walls, enormous paintings are mixed with them. You are not wanted here, you
are not needed here, and whatever the driving force behind the thick fog it
will do its best to drag you down into it and leave you there to die and
then undie, to become just another horrible creature of the night and to
terrify children in their sleep at the mere thought of you.</Description>

no limit on the number of malevolent spirits that can inhabit the space. The
same fog rolls all around this room, up to waist level on a human, nearly up
to a dwarf's or a kender's neck. It has no inhibitions as it did, because it
knows somehow that you cannot escape it now and there is no possible way
that you can run to get away from it. The deaths plotted in this room, all
the negative energies and thought engineered over the years have sat and
fermented here, building up over time and culminating in an evil so powerful
that it alone can give power to Lord Soth for centuries to come.</Description>

feel of hate, but it is replaced by the ethereal mist that drifts through
the walls and air. Two torches light the room with a blue glow, and a feel
of something sad is here, the sounds of a forsaken being fill the room with
utter despair and a wondering of why. The door to the hall is in the west
wall, but whatever is sad here wants you to feel its pain and to do
something for it before you leave ...</Description>

quietly weeping in an indeterminable place. It comes from all around and yet
nowhere at once. The sound of it is maddeningly unreal, it should not exist
at this place in time, not at a holy place like this. A shrine is in the
room, a quiet place of prayer and peace. The fog is gone from this room, but
the wisps of mist and ether drift through here. The door to the rest of the
Great Hall is to the west, but something here wants your attention before
you do anything else ...</Description>

      <Description>You are just to the east of the iron gate that kept you from the
courtyard. Now that you are in the courtyard, you can see the mist is much
thicker here. Dead grey trees rise up out of the fog, dead flowers and herbs
lie black in it. Below your feet is a stone pathway that leads east into the
courtyard. You hear water gurgling somewhere from within. The chill outdoors
is more natural, since you are very high up in the Dargaard mountains, but
it is still teeming with the feel of death and something else that you can't
define. But still, something is warm here. There are black scorches on the
stone and some of the trees around here.</Description>

      <Description>In the cold, dead courtyard that must have once been a beautiful, green
garden, not a sound is to be heard save your own. The song echoes more
faintly here, the footsteps and cries from the ruins are not as evident.
Pain and fear hang heavy in the frigid air, like the translucent white fog
that gives you chills and makes your legs feel heavier than they are. Great
trees rise up, ones that must have been wonderful shade trees in their time.
Now they are leafless and twisted, warped from the undead presence that
pervades every mote of Dargaard Keep.</Description>

      <Description>In the cold, dead courtyard that must have once been a beautiful, green
garden, not a sound is to be heard save your own. The song echoes more
faintly here, the footsteps and cries from the ruins are not as evident.
Pain and fear hang heavy in the frigid air, like the translucent white fog
that gives you chills and makes your legs feel heavier than they are. Great
trees rise up, ones that must have been wonderful shade trees in their time.
Now they are leafless and twisted, warped from the undead presence that
pervades every mote of Dargaard Keep.</Description>

      <Name>Before a fountain in the courtyard</Name>
      <Description>You stand in a clearing ringed by dead trees, their trunks warped and
mutated by the undeath here. The strange white fog is especially thick here.
And in the darkness that exists even during the day, it glows with an
otherworldly aura. You can make out a marble fountain in the center of the
clearing, covered with black moss. The liquid looks dark, but then again, it
is dark outside all of the time. The fountain continues to gurgle, and on
the air you can detect a faint odor of iron. To the south, the rest of the
courtyard exists, and a tall stone wall blocks passage east.</Description>

fruit trees planted amongst what used to be flowers and shrubbery. Now
everything is dead and grey and cold. The translucent mist laps at your

thick here. The fruit trees are now twisted and grey, like all the other
trees that are in this courtyard. Their bark doesn't look real, as if it
were an outer casing made by the evil that flows through Dargaard Keep. The
orchard appears to continue on to the east, and the rest of the courtyard is

      <Description>At this alcove of the gardens, which at one time must have been quite
cosy, a high wall stands to the west. And from underneath it, a pool of
blood is trickling. The trees here seem to feed off the foul liquid,
absorbing its energies like they once used to absorb water through their
roots. Perhaps it is through this nourishment that the plants are now
twisted and corrupt. All around, strange sounds echo. To the west, you hear
the sounds of liquid splashing. South, the rest of the courtyard drones on.</Description>

point of the room, the focal point for all the undead legions controlled by
the fallen knight that could not overcome his base selfishness in Krynn's
hour of need. The fog is too thick to breathe, too thick to even think. Some
sort of base survival instinct is in the very air, controlling what you
think and feel at this moment in time. Nothing here can change the feeling
in the Keep, nothing here can match the sheer terror and evil that radiates
from the black throne of Lord Soth.</Description>

thick on the ground like the smoke from burning green wood. It creeps up
your legs and seems to want to pull you down into it, so it can devour you
in its life-sapping essence. There is no light here, all is dark. It is not
just because you are inside; it is because something is absorbing the light.
Something sinister and evil is close, so close you can feel it, and it knows
that you are coming.</Description>

listens to the never-ending song of the undead elven maidens that were
cursed to spent forever with him. His seat is here and his arctic presence
is here, chilling you deep down to the core of your soul, glaring into your
mind with blazing orange eyes, ones that could appear any moment in front of
you, appear with a look and a word of death for you, and with that single
word of power keep you here with him until Krynn is utterly destroyed, keep
you here body and soul.</Description>

      <Name>The fourth floor of the Keep</Name>
      <Description>The mist is gone from this floor of the Keep. The halls echo strange
screams in the night and the day. It is a dream that never ends, a dream
that you can't wake up from. The undead citizens of this fortress all roam
about in the same manner, all convinced that they are merely dreaming and
that you are but a figure in the dream, perhaps sharing the same dream. This
cruel trick of the mind does much to comfort the souls that are still
trapped in the decaying bodies and rotting corpses. To the east, the
now-familiar blue-white glow of the cold torches lights the halls and
shadows things in a way that doesn't seem quite right. And all about, the
same elven song travels lightly on the dark air. West is a door that is not
very special-looking, but a cold draft comes from under it.</Description>

      <Name>On a high balcony overlooking the mountains</Name>
      <Description>On this stone balcony, with the cold air all around you and the sky
growing dark with night, you feel somehow at peace. A haunting song echoes
in the distance somewhere, a song sung by elven voices to Lord Soth. You can
see most of the Vingaard mountains from here, and looking straight down, you
can see the main gate of the keep. It is a long fall, one that would be
fatal to you. Back east, the keep reaches on, cold and dark. And somewhere,
the undead elven maidens sing to Lord Soth all night long.</Description>

      <description>Lord Soth ... The fabled Knight of Solamnia who had the power to stop the
Cataclysm but failed because of the elves. He is immense, clad in the
blackened plate mail of a Solamnic Knight, decorated with a black rose. His
deep orange eyes flicker out of what used to be eyesockets, and all around
him is an undead chill that makes you afraid ... As well you should be, for
this knight has the power to kill with a word.</description>

you as you realize that even the Solamnic Knights are not safe from Soth's

it clutches is rusted and jagged. An undead, unholy red glow fills the
skull's eyesockets as it realizes that you can be corrupted just as it was.
The chill surrounding it is as tangible as moonlight but still it exudes and
fills you with fear.</description>

      <name>skeleton undead red burning</name>
      <description>The skeleton seems to be still "alive" even though it is on fire as you
look at it. Even its bones are deep red for some reason. The skeletal hands
each clutch onto something that isn't really there ... Or is it? You notice
that one of its hands is always frozen into a knife of sorts. Deep down in
the skeleton's ribcage, there is what seems to be a black heart, beating
against all possiblity.</description>

a lot like Lord Soth, too. Proud, courageous, a bit vain. The warrior was

destruction of Krynn ... Or to do it himself.</description>

bulging arms and legs, fur stripped away to reveal maggots devouring the
rotting flesh, an odor so rank you can barely stand it. The minotaur towers
above you, nine feet tall, brandishing a club as thick as one of its arms.
In its eyes burns undead evil, a red fire welling up deep inside it. As it
shifts its arms to raise its club, part of its tunic falls away, and you see
maggots writhing inside, falling onto the floor along with rotten black
gore, spattering onto you, releasing an odor so foul you want to vomit.</description>

      <name>dog hellhound hound infernal hunting</name>
      <description>This dog is also a product of the undead power that soaks Dargaard Keep.
Wandering about, searching, hunting still for meat and a kill, hunting like
it used to, driven by basic instincts and the undead bloodlust. It will eat
anything it can, devouring corpses with relish and feasting on the flesh
that it finds. Hellfire rages in the eyes, fur is stripped, revealing raw
undead muscle, gaping, pus-filled wounds, and bare patches of ribs.</description>

      <description>The dracolich is surrounded by a perpetual black aura of hatred and evil.
It is outfitted in black battle armor, the kind that dragonriders use for
their mounts. On the breast of the armor is the signet of Dargaard Keep, and
that can only mean that this enormous red beast is Lord Soth's personal
mount, to ride into battle and to bring about more death, more loss of life.
As it sees you, the dragon opens wide its mouth and hisses, blasting the
room with hot, putrid breath. This contrasts sharply with the horrid chill
that radiates from its body.</description>

      <description>The drow looks up at you. You can see that his face is beginning to
tighten and become wrinkled with the powers that he uses. The powers are
taking his life slowly, but he knows his fate: to be resurrected as a lich
in Lord Soth's service. He is here to learn very difficult spells of
necromancy from the one man who can teach him more.</description>

      <name>nightgaunt black</name>
      <description>The creature ... A nightgaunt, something conjured out of blackest horror
and fear. It is oily and smooth, covered with thick, rubbery black hide and
has two large horns on its head, stretching outwardss and curving back in.
Its wings make no noise, its tail lashes needlessly and disturbingly. It
does not speak, it does not even grin, for it has no face, just a blackness
where a face should be. All it does is fly and crush and lash its tail. Such
is its way.</description>

      <name>ghoul creature</name>
      <description>The something appears to be some sort of ghoul, but you can't tell for
certain. It is vaguely humanoid, vaguely canine ... It is something very
foul and odious. The loathsome air around it stinks almost as bad as a
dragon does, but with some sort of difference to it. The creature's hide is
rubbery and unpleasant, covering a body that slumps forward, and has two
arms ending in sharp claws, all topped with a dog-like head full of sharp,
jagged incisors. It walks about on hoof-feet, something very odd ... There
is something decidedly unnatural about the beast, whatever it may be.</description>
